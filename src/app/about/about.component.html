        Hello! My name is Uyen and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. My
        interest in web development started back in 2012 when I decided to try editing custom
        Tumblr themes â€” turns out hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot
        about HTML &amp; CSS!
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at
        <a href="https://www.macquarie.com.au/">an advertising agency</a>,
        <a href="https://starry.com/">a start-up</a>,
        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">a huge corporation</a>, and
        <a href="https://scout.camd.northeastern.edu/">a student-led design studio</a>. My
        main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and digital
        experiences at <a href="https://upstatement.com/">Upstatement</a> for a variety of
        clients.
      </p>

        I also recently
        <a href="https://www.newline.co/courses/build-a-spotify-connected-app">
          launched a course
        </a>
        that covers everything you need to build a web app with the Spotify API using Node
        &amp; React.

      <p>Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:</p>
